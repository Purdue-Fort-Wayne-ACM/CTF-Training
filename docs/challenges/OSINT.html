            Let's start with the camera settings. When you take a picture, the phone or camera will save a little bit of
            information about the image in addition to the picture taken. This 'metadata' as we call it stores settings
            such as lens, aperture (how much light was let in), shutter speed (how long the shutter was open for), and
            more. There are plenty of free metadata viewers online.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finding the viewing the metadata, we found the camera settings, but unfortunately not the location of
            the image. We can try reverse image search to see if there are any hits. In doing this, we can see that
            there are two possible hits, one on a photo site and one on an Instagram post. Both were taken in the same
            city, but can we get down to the bridge? The Instagram post could help us with that. It was taken by Cloud
            Gate (aka the 'Chicago Bean'). On google maps, it shows that there are only two bridges near the bean, one
            to the east and one to the south. The one to the east doesn't seem to fit, so it must be the one to the
            south! We can then check what building the bridge is connecting.

            These seem to follow the same pattern, a name then a title. We can make a guess that these might be author's
            and their books or something similar. If we google one of the names, we can see that they are actors. If we
            google the title, we can see that these are all names of Doctor Who episodes. Let's use IMDb to figure out
            any other information about each episode. Let's try it with the last one, the <i>Forest of the Dead</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the cast, we can see that <i>Catherine Tate</i> is one of the actors who credited for the
            episode. We seem to be on the right track! If we do this with the others, we will also see that they follow
            the same pattern.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's check the details of each episode to see if anything matches. If we look under filming locations, we
            can see that they all share a common filming location! Looking into this, we see that there are a total of 7
            (as of writing) episodes that use this location on IMDb.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine what the correct episode is, we can check which one (outside of the three that we know) has the
            actor <i>Billie Piper</i> credited in.

            You will quickly realize that reverse image search does not give any valuable information. So, we will need
            to resort to our powers of observation! We know that this is from a video. We know this both from the way
            that the question is asked and how the image is composed like a 'react' video from YouTube or other popular
            video sharing platforms. For this section, we will assume that this image is taken from a YouTube video
            given the aspect ratio. So, we have an idea of where to search once we get more information on the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking specifically at the video that is being reacted to in the image we can gain some more information.
            We can clearly see that the video has something on fire, however, the fire looks odd. Instead of being a
            more traditional match/firewood/etc. fire, it is a brilliant white. This might seem to be inconsequential,
            but we can gain more information from this. Next looking closely, we can see that the video was taken in
            what seems to be a parking lot. Looking at this, it seems that the thing burning is likely made of some
            metal. To determine this, we can look up <code>metals that burn white</code>, we get metals such as
            Magnesium, Titanium, Nickle, Chromium, and Aluminum. Given that the burning object takes up a small amount
            of space in the parking spot, we can assume that the burning metal object is also lightweight. Some common
            metals that are used in transportation and are light weight, we can safely assume that it is made of either
            aluminum or titanium. So, we know what the item is made of, but what could it be? For that, we can look up
            things that are commonly made of aluminum and are small. This will lead to something like a bike or scooter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these also have 'electric' versions of them. Next, we can see what powers the electric version of a
            bike or scooter. This will lead to a type of battery. Our instinct is confirmed as well given our last
            question is asking what type of battery is the cause of the fire. After googling
            <code>electric scooter battery</code>, we can see that they are commonly using Lithium-Ion batteries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at it we know now; we know that we are looking for a YouTube video, in which the YouTuber is
            reacting to a video of an e-scooter or e-bike on fire that was powered by a lithium-ion battery that failed.
            Knowing this, we know that the YouTube video will likely not have 'Lithium Ion Battery', 'e-bike fire', or
            'e-scooter fire'. We can then return to google for more information. When googling
            <code>lithium-ion battery "slang"</code>, we will get "spicy pillow" as slang/common saying for 'Lithium-Ion
            Batteries'. This seems like something that might be a good YouTube video title. So, let's google
            <code>YouTuber reacts to spicy pillows</code>. The first result shows a YouTuber or seems to look similar to
            the one in our screenshot. Watching/skimming through the first result on YouTube, we can quickly confirm
            that this is the video that the screenshot was taken from.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can then go to the subreddit that posted the video using the keywords that were given in the video right
            before the YouTuber's reaction to the video. We should be able to find the video that was being reacted to.
            It turns out that the video was reposted from another subreddit. The subreddit that it was originally posted
            on is a country's subreddit, so we have answer 3. We can then use google translate to determine the rest of
            the answers.
